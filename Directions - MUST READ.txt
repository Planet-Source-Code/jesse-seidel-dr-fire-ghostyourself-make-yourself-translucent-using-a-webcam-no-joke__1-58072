1. Start the program and set the slider control to 255 (All the way down).

2. Move out of view of your webcam so your not visible in ANY part of the picture.

3. Press the Set BG button.

4. Make sure nothing has moved and lighting conditions are exactly the same.

5. Now go back into view of the webcam and change the slider control to what you
want. Down is more opaque, and up is more transparent. I found the best setting is
180 for the best ghostly effect!

If your wondering what the default background picture is, that's a picture of my room
I was using for testing.


Enjoy being a ghost :p
